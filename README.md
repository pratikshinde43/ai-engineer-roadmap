# 🚀 AI Engineer Roadmap (Feb 2026 – Aug 2026)

This repository documents my **structured transition from Data Engineer to AI / Senior ML Engineer**, focusing on **production-grade machine learning and LLM systems**.

---

## 🎯 Background

I come from a **Data Engineering background** with experience in:

- Azure, Databricks, PySpark  
- Data pipelines, ETL, streaming systems  

**Time commitment:** ~1.5–2 hours per day  
**Goal:** Become a **production-ready AI / ML Engineer** who can design, build, deploy, and operate ML & LLM systems.

# 🧠 Philosophy

> **This repo focuses on real, production-style ML and LLM systems — not toy notebooks.**  
The goal is to learn:
- How to build ML systems  
- How to deploy them  
- How to monitor them  
- And how to operate them in production  

---

# 🎯 End Goal

> Become an AI / ML Engineer who can design **end-to-end intelligent systems** — from data ingestion to production deployment and monitoring.

---

# 📌 Progress Tracking

Each month will contain:

- Notes  
- Code  
- Architecture  
- Learnings  
- Production patterns  

---

# 🧭 Motto

> **AI Engineering is not about fancy models.  
It is about building reliable, useful systems around real data.**
